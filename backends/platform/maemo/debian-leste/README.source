DFSG concerns
-------------

Upstream source contains:

 *  bundled cxxtest (also provided by package "cxxtest") 3.10.1 (2004) in

        test/cxxtest

 * bundled freefonts (also provided by package "fonts-freefont-ttf") in

        gui/themes/scummmodern/*.ttf
        gui/themes/fonts/*.ttf


However neither of them installed in process of building debian packages.
